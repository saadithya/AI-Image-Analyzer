<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="small">Last updated: <strong><!--DATE--> </strong></p>


<p>Thank you for using <strong>AI Image Analyzer</strong> (the “Extension”). We built this Extension with a strong commitment to privacy. This policy explains what data (if any) we collect, why we collect it, how it is stored, and the controls you have.</p>


<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The Extension does not collect personal information or telemetry.</li>
<li><strong>Local processing:</strong> Image analysis and caption generation occur on your device—no images or content are uploaded to our servers.</li>
<li><strong>Permissions:</strong> The Extension requests only minimal permissions required for functionality. See details below.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What data the Extension accesses</h2>
<p>The extension accesses only the image the user chooses to analyze (via right-click context menu). It also stores small user settings and a local history of recent actions in the browser storage. Specific items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image data</strong> — The image you right-click is fetched for local analysis and/or for packaging into a downloaded file if you choose “Save with AI Description.” This is processed locally and not sent anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Local settings</strong> — Settings such as image resize dimensions and whether to prefix filenames with the date are stored locally using Chrome <code>chrome.storage</code>.</li>
<li><strong>History</strong> — A short local history of recent image checks and saves (max 50 entries) is stored in local storage so the popup can show recent activity. This history is stored only on your device.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Permissions & why they are required</h2>
<pre>
storage — Store extension settings and local history (local device only)
downloads — Save image files to the user's Downloads folder
contextMenus — Add right-click menu entries for images
scripting — Inject a small content script when required for pixel-level analysis
notifications — Notify users when analyses complete or files are saved
host_permissions — Limited to common image file types (jpg, png, webp, jpeg) to fetch the image the user selects
</pre>


<h2>Do we transmit data off your device?</h2>
<p>No. The Extension does not upload images, content, or usage data to external servers. All analysis is performed locally using the browser's capabilities (Chrome AI APIs where available and a local Web Worker). We do not collect analytics or crash reports.</p>


<h2>Third-party services</h2>
<p>The extension loads a publicly-hosted TensorFlow.js model for client-side inference (if available) and may load TFJS runtime from a CDN inside the worker to perform local analysis. These requests are only used to fetch necessary code/models and are not tied to your identity. If you prefer, you can host the TFJS resources locally in the extension package to avoid CDN requests.</p>


<h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can clear the local history from the extension popup ("Clear History").</li>
<li>You can remove or disable the extension at any time via Chrome's Extensions page.</li>
<li>Because no personal data is collected, there are no data export or deletion requests related to external servers.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We follow best practices to minimize risks: minimal permissions, local-only processing, and no remote storage of user images. However, please note that downloaded files written to your filesystem are subject to your operating system's security and permissions.</p>


<h2>Children</h2>
<p>The Extension is not designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>


<h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
